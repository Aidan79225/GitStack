"""Live theme switching helpers.

`connect_widget` wires a widget to refresh on `ThemeManager.theme_changed`.
For widgets that built their stylesheet from f-strings (and cached the
result), pass `rebuild` so the stylesheet is rebuilt before update().

The connection is explicitly disconnected when the widget's C++ object is
destroyed (via the `destroyed` signal). This prevents `RuntimeError:
Internal C++ object already deleted` when the theme changes after a
widget has been removed (e.g. closing a diff and reopening another).
